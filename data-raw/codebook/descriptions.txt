# Network data on cases

This dataset includes network data for infringement cases. Network data is similar to directed dyad-year data except that it only includes directed dyad-years with at least one infringement case. For every year, there is one node per department and one node per member state. Edges can only exist between a department and a member state. There is an edge between a department and a member state if and only if the department opened at least one case against the member state during that year. The weight of the edge is the number of cases that the department opened against the member state. There is one observation per department per member state per year (2002-2020), excluding directed dyad-years where the state was not a member of the EU, but only if count of cases is positive.

# Network data on cases (by case type)

This dataset includes multi-dimensional network data for infringement cases. There is one dimension per case type (noncommunication vs nonconformity). Network data is similar to directed dyad-year data except that it only includes directed dyad-years with at least one infringement case with respect to each case type. For every year, there is one node per department and one node per member state. Edges can only exist between a department and a member state. There is an edge between a department and a member state with respect to each case type if and only if the department opened at least one case against the member state during that year. The weight of the edge is the number of cases that the department opened against the member state. There is one observation per department per member state per year per case type (2002-2020), excluding directed dyad-years where the state was not a member of the EU, but only if the count of cases is positive.
