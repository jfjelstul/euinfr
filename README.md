# The euinfr Package

This R package provides tools for easily accessing from the API for the European Union Infringement Procedure (EUIP) dataset by Josh Fjelstul, Ph.D. The EUIP dataset has a REST API that users can call to get data on the European Union (EU) infringement procedure, including data on infringement cases, data on decisions in infringement cases made by the European Commission, time-varying data by member state, and time-varying data by Directorate-General. Directorates-General (DGs) are the various departments of the European Commission that manage individual infringement cases.

See examples and read the documentation on the [package site](https://jfjelstul.github.io/euinfr/index.html). 

This package is currently in development.
