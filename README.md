# The euinfr Package

This package provides a function for getting data from the API for the European Union Infringement Procedure (EUIP) dataset by Josh Fjelstul, Ph.D. The EUIP dataset has a REST API that users can call to get data on the European Union (EU) infringement procedure, including data on infringement cases, data on specific decisions made in cases by the European Commission, summary statistics by member state, and summary statistics by Directorate-General. Directorates-General are the various departments of the European Commission that manage individual infringement cases.
